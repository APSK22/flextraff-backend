## 🔄 Pipeline Workflows

### 1. **Main CI/CD Pipeline** (`ci-cd.yml`)
**Triggers:** Push/PR to `main` or `develop` branches

#### Stage 1: Fast Tests (⚡ ~20 seconds)
- **Environment:** Ubuntu Latest, Python 3.11
- **Dependency Caching:** Pip cache for faster builds
- **Test Scope:** 
  - Unit Tests: Core business logic validation
  - Algorithm Tests: Traffic calculation algorithms
  - API Tests: Endpoint functionality with mocked dependencies
- **Strategy:** Developer-friendly approach excluding slow integration tests

#### Stage 2: Security Scanning (🔒 ~15 seconds)
- **Bandit Security Scan:** Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Safety Check:** Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Reporting:** JSON output for detailed analysis

#### Stage 3: Deployment Trigger (🚀 Main branch only)
- **Automatic Render Deployment:** Triggered on main branch success
- **Health Check Validation:** Post-deployment verification

### 2. **Deployment Validation** (`deploy.yml`)
**Triggers:** Push to `main` branch, Manual dispatch

#### Validation Process:
1. **Pre-deployment Tests:** Essential unit tests validation
2. **Production Health Check:** Current deployment status verification
3. **Deployment Notification:** Automated status reporting
4. **Render Integration:** Seamless deployment via GitHub integration
